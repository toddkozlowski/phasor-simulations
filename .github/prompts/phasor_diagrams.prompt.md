description: Develop a Python framework and program to quickly generate publication-quality phasor diagrams.
---
Develop a simple python framework for singular, personal use to generate illustrations for publication. There is no need to develop user-facing tools, or to generalize the project beyond the small number of use cases defined here. The framework should be designed to quickly generate publication-quality phasor diagrams, with a focus on clarity and readability. The program should be able to generate a variety of phasor diagrams, including single phasor diagrams, multiple phasor diagrams, and phasor diagrams with specific annotations or labels. The phasors are all represented on the cartesian complex plane in the form of arrows. The diagrams should be all focused around the positive quadrant (with only enough of the negative quadrants showing for context).

ILLUSTRATIONS:
1. A single phasor diagram with one phasor, oriented at 45 degrees, with a magnitude of 1 with the phasor originating from the origin (0,0) and extending to the point (0.707, 0.707). A curved arrow should indicate the counterclockwise direction of rotation, and the angle of the phasor with respect to the positive real axis should be indicated with a label showing "\phi = \omega t".

2. An illustration of the summation of two phasors, where the first phasor is oriented at 45 degrees with a magnitude of 1, and the second phasor is oriented also at 45 degrees with a magnitude of 0.5, indicating constructive interference. The diagram should show the first phasor originating from the origin (0,0) and extending to the point (0.707, 0.707), and the second phasor originating from the head of the first phasor and extending to the point (1.061, 1.061). The resultant phasor should be shown originating from near the origin and extending to near the point (1.061, 1.061), clearly indicating that it is the vector sum of the two individual phasors.
A second illustration should show the same two phasors, but with the second phasor oriented at 225 degrees, indicating destructive interference. The diagram should show the first phasor originating from the origin (0,0) and extending to the point (0.707, 0.707), and the second phasor originating from the head of the first phasor and extending to the point (0.354, 0.354). The resultant phasor should be shown originating from near the origin and extending to near the point (0.354, 0.354), clearly indicating that it is the vector sum of the two individual phasors.
A third illustration should show two phasors of equal magnitude (1), the first again oriented at 45 degrees and the second oriented at 135 degrees, indicating orthogonal phasors. The diagram should show the first phasor originating from the origin (0,0) and extending to the point (0.707, 0.707), and the second phasor originating from the head of the first phasor and extending to the point (0, 1). The resultant phasor should be shown originating from near the origin and extending to near the point (0.707, 1), clearly indicating that it is the vector sum of the two individual phasors.

3. Illustration of amplitude modulation. In the first illustration, a carrier phasor is oriented at 45 degrees with a magnitude of 1. A double-headed arrow aligned with the phasor and centered near (but offset from, for visual clarity) the head of the carrier phasor should indicate the amplitude of the carrier varying with time. The length of this indicating arrow should be 0.4. In a second illustration, two modulation phasors are added, each one with a magnitude of 0.2. In these illustrations, the "upper sideband" which is rotating counterclockwise is added tip-to-tail to the end of the carrier, and the "lower sideband" likewise added to the end of the "upper sideband". The second illustration is broken into 4 components to represent the phasors at different points in time. In each illustration component, the upper sideband should have a curved arrow to indicate rotation, with an arc equal to the radius of the circle it traces out (0.2) and be pointed "counter clockwise" with the tail of the curved arrow  near (but not exactly at) the head of the upper sideband modulation phasor. Likewise for the lower sideband, in the clockwise direction. Draw a circle for each modulation sideband phasor, which is centered on the phasor origin and has a radius of the length of the phasor. Thus, the arched arrows should lie on or near these circles.
a) at time t=0, the two phasors are aligned with carrier, each at 45 degrees, and the resultant phasor points to near the point (1.02, 1.02)
b) at time t = T/4, the upper sideband is oriented at 135 degrees and the lower sideband is oriented at 315 degrees, and the resultant phasor points to near the point (0.707, 0.707) as the two modulation phasors cancel each other out.
c) at time t = T/2, the two phasors are again aligned with the carrier, but now in the opposite direction at 225 degrees, and the resultant phasor points to near the point (0.39, 0.39)
d) at time t = 3T/4, the upper sideband is oriented at 315 degrees and the lower sideband is oriented at 135 degrees, and the resultant phasor points to near the point (0.707, 0.707) as the two modulation phasors again cancel each other out.

4. Illustration of phase modulation. In the first illustration, a carrier phasor is oriented at 45 degrees with a magnitude of 1. A curved, double-headed arrow aligned is positioned orthogonal to the carrier phasor and centered near the tip of the arrow. The arc of the arrow should be the radius of the carrier, 1. 

5. Illustration of fields in an optical cavity. In all of the illustrations, an initial phasor of length 1 is oriented along the positive complex axis (vertically), representing the initial field in the cavity. A second phasor of length r is oriented at an angle phi with respect to the first phasor. A third phasor of length r^2 is added to the end of the second phasor, with an angle phi with respect to the second phasor. This process is repeated for a total of n phasors chained together, tip-to-tail of the preceeding, with the final phasor having a length of r^n. The resultant phasor is shown originating from near the origin and extending to near the final end of the final vector, clearly indicating that it is the vector sum of all individual phasors. 
Illustration 1: all three of these are plotted on the same diagram, the first chain of arrows (a) in blue, the second (b) in green and the third (c) in orange, with the resultant phasor for each string plotted in a darker shade of the same color. The parameters for each string of arrows are as follows:
a). r = 0.8, phi = -10 degrees, n = 100
b). r = 0.8, phi = -3 degrees, n = 100
c). r = 0.8, phi = 0 degrees, n = 100
Additionally, draw a circle with a dotted line centered at (manual input) with a radius of (manual input).

Illustration 2: again, three chains of arrows:
a). r = 0.8, phi = -3 degrees, n = 100
b). r = 0.9, phi = -3 degrees, n = 100
c). r = 0.95, phi = -3 degrees, n = 100
Additionally, draw a circle with a dotted line centered at (manual input) with a radius of (manual input).

Generate 5 separate functions within main.py which each generate one of the above illustrations, with the parameters for each illustration hardcoded into the function. Each function should save the resulting diagram as a high-resolution PNG file with an appropriate filename indicating the content of the diagram into the /images directory, as well as a vector .eps file of the same. The functions should be designed to be easily called from a main block, allowing for quick generation of all diagrams when the script is run. The code should be well-organized and commented to explain the purpose of each section and any important details about the implementation. The program should be easily modifiable, for example to allow to me quickly change the color or line style of the phasors, add or remove or move circles, or to adjust the parameters of the phasors for each illustration.

STYLE:
The style of the diagrams should be clean and minimalist, with a focus on clarity and readability. Do start, do not add any labels, tick marks, or grid lines. If any of these elements are desired for a specific plot, it will be explicitly requested in the prompt. The diagrams should use a consistent color scheme, with different colors used to distinguish between different phasors or groups of phasors.
For multiple arrows which are summed, the tail of the second arrow should be placed at the head of the first arrow, and so on for any additional arrows. There should be no gap between the tip of the arrow of the preceding arrow and the tail of the next. The final diagram should clearly show the resultant phasor, which is the vector sum of all individual phasors. The resultant phasor should be visually distinct from the individual phasors, using a different color or line style to differentiate it from the others. Only include text which is explicitly requested. Use sleek, modern, minimal design choices. These are illustrations, not data plots. Any text should be rendered in a basic serif font to match the style of manuscript.
